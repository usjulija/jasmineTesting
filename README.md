# Project Overview
The project was given as a part of Udacity Front-End-Nanodegree program, css, js and html were provided. The goal of this project was to accomplish testing using Jasmine.
The tasks of the project:

* Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
* Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
* Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`.
* Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
* Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
* Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
* Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
* Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.
* Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
* No test should be dependent on the results of another.
* Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested.
* Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
* When complete - all of your tests should pass.
